title:  "Demonstrating some text formatting examples"
categories: text
---

This paragraph contains some example text. You can, for instance, make text **appear bold**. Or look at this shiny *italic text*. And why not combine both for some ***bold italic text***. Now `this` is what a `code fragment` looks like, which is enclosed by backticks in markdown.

And [this](https://github.com) is what a link looks like. But don't name your links *this*, use some meaningful description like [github](https://github.com).


Only the previous paragraphs will be visible on your home page if you have page excerpts enabled, the complete text will only appear when you click on the post. If you think the following lists are just too boring you can skip to the next post which will show some example objects.

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

### Lists

#### Unordered

 * normal item
 * *special item*
 * another normal item
 * **important item**

#### Ordered

1. yet another normal item
2. don't forget the *special item*
3. another boring item
4. and look at this **very important item**
