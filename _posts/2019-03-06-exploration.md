I had a dream that we were all making our way down a river that we had awoken in, newborn, naked and splashing, bewildered. The current was swift, and the river’s bank was treacherous and inaccessible. We had no choice but to start swimming. As we moved with the water, we grew, and we witnessed our experiences play out around us in elaborate metaphors.

I found my first great love in a tumultuous and seemingly lonely stretch of the river near childhood’s end. My arms were getting tired, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to keep my head above the water much longer. I saw the same fatigue and loneliness in her eyes that I knew must be in mine, and so I swam over to her. Together, we found that we could keep one another afloat through the rapids. When we reached calm waters again, we were afraid to separate, and so clung to one another as the current swept us downstream.

The river widened, and joined and was joined by other rivers bringing their own drifting refugees, and some of us began to thrive. Others, who had not been as lucky, succumbed to the churn of the water. Their bodies left wakes of confused mourners. In the midst of all of this, we swam together.

Among the meandering crowd of humans moving their way down the river, though, we missed that others had begun to share logs, and then to create rafts, boats, flotillas. Entire communities of shared understanding and support had began to develop, unknown to us, and all the while we clung jealously to our own love. Coveted one another in totality. As if we were the only thing in the world that either of us needed.

As we continued to grow, though, and to make our way down the river, our togetherness began to impede our progress. We struggled through rapids that were too narrow and too dangerous for us to stay interlocked, but we were deathly afraid of separation. There came a point where neither of us could support the other any longer, and so we began slowly sinking. In the midst of contemplating our shared doom, we wondered for the first time aloud if we might yet survive, if only we pushed away from one another. Even in that brief separation, for the first time in years, we were forced to rely upon ourselves. We liked it. We found that, in the near-decade that we had been together, our mutual support and growth had built both of us up enough that we were more than capable of swimming on our own.

Inspired by the confidence and autonomy that my freshly discovered ability afforded me, I began to swim freely, if slowly, among the inscrutable communities of the river. I found myself occasionally pacing alongside them long enough to learn and marvel at the vibrancy and security of life aboard. A life where there was no struggle to stay afloat, where the beauty of the river could be appreciated. Suspecting, somehow, that I had missed my opportunity to join this life, I resigned myself to a solitary existence, among it, but apart. I closed my eyes to the world and set myself adrift.

I drifted for weeks. The isolation was an escalating scream, saying nothing — finally, when it felt as if my mind would soon entirely slip away from the maddening silence, I heard a distant shout. I opened my eyes.

I saw someone reaching out. Laying flat on her stomach, on the edge of the makeshift collection of houseboats whose wake I'd been drifting in, she stretched out a pole, and pulled me up and out of the water.

In the light and heat of her hearth, where she offered me a towel, I felt warm for the first time in my life. *This must be love*, I thought. I’d never felt anything like it. To bask in her kindness and warmth was to forsake knowledge of the chill of the river. It was comfort and acceptance and understanding such as I had never known. I thought she was an angel. I thought she was my savior, and that she had been directed by the cosmos to reach out to me.

As a soul that had spent the last two decades barely afloat, even her simple care for me was overwhelming. I could feel the sensation swirling and concentrating in my mind, as she flitted in and out of the room, checking on me each time. The last time that she did, in my confused, post-traumatic haze, I confessed to her that I thought I had fallen in love.

She paused, sat down, and nodded. “I can see why you might feel that way...,” she slowly began, “...but I’ve only just pulled you out of the water.” She paused.

“You looked cold. We’ve been watching you swim.”

*We?* I thought.

She read the question in my face. She was really good at that.

“All of us!, ” she said, gesturing around. “Your friends! You’ve been drifting behind us for a while, we thought you might want a chance to really rest. A couple of us have tried reaching out, I was just the one that managed to get your attention. You just got out of the water — it’s okay to be a little confused!” She smiled. “You can get better acquainted with everyone later, if you like, but rest now. When you’re ready, you’re more than welcome to build your home here. We support and trust one another. It’s a long way — we’re here to let you know that you don’t have to swim to get there.”

I slowly blinked, and turned, and realized that the room was indeed full of people. Somehow, I hadn't noticed. Seeing them now, their silhouettes strangely familiar, I realized that they were there the whole time — up on the rafts, keeping watch. Watching for survivors. Some of them were broken too, or injured, or not whole; each in turn had the air of an individual that had accepted how things are and begun the long process of convalescence.

Understanding gripped me, just as I felt that I was being pulled up and away from the flotilla. I looked and saw the vast makeshift collection of boats below me, tightly knit and bathed in flickering lantern light, like a village nestled in the countryside. In that brief moment, as my vision faded, I turned my gaze to the horizon and witnessed the river below, undulating and broad, silvery in the reflected moonlight, as it snaked its way across an eternal plain of colorless grass. Off in the distance, impossibly far away, a faint cloud of mist marked a waterfall that plunged infinitely into the unknown.

The dream ended. I awoke, and found that I was back in the world, alone at twenty four in the basement bedroom of a big and empty house. But I found myself thinking that, somehow, something felt different. I no longer felt like I was drifting along, barely keeping my head above the water. I felt like I was aboard. I felt, for the first time that I can remember, that the ability to thrive was within my grasp.

It’s the responsibility of all of us, here on the flotillas, to pull the stragglers we can find up and out of the water. To show them empathy, and kindness, and acceptance, and support. The river pulls us all toward the falls, but we don’t have to swim to get there.
