title: to you
---

I've never met anyone like you before. I've never felt this way about anyone, ever.
I've never even felt an emotion of a remotely comparable magnitude. It's like I was
living in a world of black and grey, and then you walked into my life in all of your
colorful, dazzling, blinding beauty and warmth and light and kindness and depth. It's
like seeing the sunrise over the mountains after an eternity spent shivering in
the bleak pre-dawn.

I didn't believe in this kind of love, until I realized that I had it for you all along.
