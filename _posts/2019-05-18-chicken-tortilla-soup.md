This is an easy recipe, and a favorite of mine. It's also my first time writing a recipe from scratch, so feel free to offer suggestions or feedback via the contact mechanisms mentioned on my "About" page.



## ingredients
### soup
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 32 fl. oz (~1L) chicken stock
- 1 can (16 oz or ~450g) black beans
- 7 oz (~200g) corn - I'm lazy and typically use 1/2 of a package of Trader Joe's frozen "Mexican style corn", which comes with cotija cheese that you can use as a garnish
- Spices
    - Cumin, garlic powder
    - Oregano, basil
    - Cinnamon and salt
    - 2 frozen cilantro cubes (coriander leaves)
- 1 can (6 oz or ~170g) tomato paste 

### base
- 4 oz (~120g) Monterey Jack cheese (or preferred alternative)
- 6 corn tortillas
- 1 avocado
- cooking oil (I use avocado oil)

## instructions

This recipe can be cooked in a slow cooker or a pressure cooker. You can adapt it to the stovetop, too: just cook the chicken with your preferred technique, cook the soup in a saucepan on the stove *without* the chicken, and then shred the chicken and combine prior to serving.

### prepare the soup
1. Combine the chicken, chicken stock, black beans, and corn in your slow cooker or pressure cooker (do not add the chicken if cooking on the stovetop)
2. Add the tomato paste and stir it into the soup to distribute it
3. Add spices to taste - approximately even amounts of cumin and garlic powder, even and smaller amounts of oregano and basil, a small amount of cinnamon and salt, and two frozen cubes of cilantro
4. Cook until the chicken is fully cooked
    - For Instant Pot electric pressure cookers, I cook for 35 minutes on the "Meat/Stew" setting
    - For slow cookers, typically low to medium heat for 6 to 8 hours
    - For stovetop - cook the soup on medium-high heat until it has an even texture and heat, stirring often (cook the chicken with your preferred technique separately)
    - Consult the internet for your preferred cooking technique to determine when chicken is safe to eat

### prepare the base (right before serving)
1. Cut the tortillas into thin ribbons and fry them on the stove in a small amount of cooking oil. As they're frying, season lightly to taste. Set aside.
2. Cut the Montery Jack cheese into small cubes, 2 oz per serving, and set aside
3. Cut the avocado into small cubes or slices, half of the avocado per serving, and set aside
4. Combine the cheese, tortillas, and avocado into one bowl per serving

### combine
1. When the chicken is fully cooked, stir the soup to evenly spread the ingredients
2. Ladle preferred portions over the prepared base
