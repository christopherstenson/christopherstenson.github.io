description: "Precious little is known about the floating cities of Venus. The inhabitants appear to be almost human - spectrochemical analysis of the atmosphere within the domes suggests the creatures within respire just as we do, and we've seen them (albeit only via video drone) to resemble humans in appearance. What tells us they are not us is the technology: the mechanism providing lift to the cities, made visible by the high-energy plasma rings encircling the spiked base, is not currently able to be explained by human science. Neither is the material of the domes, which is transparent only to highly specific portions of the electromagnetic spectrum and otherwise impenetrable to both energy and matter. The inhabitants appear to prefer being left alone. They've ignored all diplomatic attempts."
