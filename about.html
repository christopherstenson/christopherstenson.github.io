Hi! I'm a curious non-binary mostly-male-looking human in Seattle. When talking about me, I prefer that people use "they/them/their", because I don't identify as either male or female and consider their respective pronouns to be incorrect for me.
I'm employed as a software engineer for Tableau, a Seattle-based data visualization company with a mission to "help people see and understand data." Tableau is a good fit -- I think that the Tableau Foundation does good in the world, and I enjoy working for a company that charges up-front for its products: there's no incentive to sacrifice ethics for ad revenue.
In my free time, I like to snap pictures with my Pixel, draw digitally, and sometimes to write short stories+poems. I try to push my interest bubble, but inevitably I find that the loci are frequently cities, engineering, mental health, and cute fluffy animals. I'm primarily motivated by empowerment: what can a human do when their barriers to success are removed?

To get in touch with me, shoot me an email at chris @ chrisstenson.dev or message me on Twitter (profile link in the nav bar).
