Hi! I'm a curious non-binary mostly-male-looking human in Seattle. When talking about me, I prefer that people use "they/them/their",
 because I don't identify as either male or female and consider their respective pronouns to be incorrect for me.    
<br/>
I'm employed as a software engineer for Tableau, a Seattle-based data visualization company with a mission to 
"help people see and understand data." In my free time, I like to snap pictures with my Pixel, 
draw digitally, and sometimes to write short stories+poems. I try to push my interest bubble,
but inevitably I find that the loci are frequently cities, engineering, mental health, and cute fluffy animals. 
I'm primarily motivated by empowerment: what can a human do when their barriers to success are removed?    
<br/>
