        Hi! I'm a curious non-binary mostly-male-looking human in Seattle. When talking about me, I prefer that people
        use "they/them/their",
        because I don't identify as either male or female and consider their respective pronouns to be incorrect for me.
        <br />
        <hr>
        I'm employed as a software engineer for Tableau, a Seattle-based data visualization company with a mission to
        "help people see and understand data." In my free time, I like to snap pictures with my Pixel,
        draw digitally, and sometimes to write short stories+poems. I try to push my interest bubble,
        but inevitably I find that the loci are frequently cities, engineering, mental health, and cute fluffy animals.
        I'm primarily motivated by empowerment: what can a human do when their barriers to success are removed?
        <br />
